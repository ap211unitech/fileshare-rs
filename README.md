# üìÅ fileshare-rs

**fileshare-rs** is a secure, end-to-end encrypted file sharing web service built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum). Inspired by services like Firefox Send (RIP) and WeTransfer, it allows users to upload files and share secure download links with optional password protection, expiry, and download limits.

> üîê Designed with security and simplicity in mind ‚Äî easily self-hostable and privacy-focused.

## üö® Security considerations

- If database got hacked, user credentials won't be exposed as it is being hashed before inserting in database.

- For files, if anyone somehow gets file_id for some file, it won't be possible for him to see the actual file as it's been encrypted before getting stored in cloud.

- User credentials are securely hashed before being stored in the database, so even if the database is compromised, the original passwords remain protected.

- Files are encrypted before being uploaded to the cloud. Therefore, even if an attacker obtains a valid `file_id`, they cannot access the actual content without the decryption key.

- The encryption keys are not stored alongside the encrypted files, reducing the risk of unauthorized decryption even if cloud storage is compromised.

- Access to sensitive endpoints (e.g., file upload, download, or user settings) should be gated behind proper authentication and authorization layers.

- Use HTTPS for all client-server communications to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure data-in-transit is encrypted.
